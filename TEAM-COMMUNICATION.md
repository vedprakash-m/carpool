## 🚨 **IMPORTANT: Node.js 22 Upgrade Completed**

**Date:** January 2025  
**Affected:** All developers, CI/CD, production environment  
**Action Required:** Yes - Local environment update needed

---

## 📋 **What Happened**

The vCarpool project has been successfully upgraded from **Node.js 18** to **Node.js 22.16.0 LTS**. This upgrade provides:

- ✅ **Enhanced Performance** - Faster build times and runtime execution
- ✅ **Improved Security** - Latest security patches and vulnerability fixes
- ✅ **Future-Proof Support** - LTS support until April 2027
- ✅ **Better Developer Experience** - Enhanced debugging and tooling

---

## 🚀 **Required Actions for All Developers**

### **1. Update Your Local Environment (REQUIRED)**

```bash
# Install Node.js 22.16.0 using nvm (recommended)
nvm install 22.16.0
nvm use 22.16.0
nvm alias default 22.16.0

# Verify installation
node --version  # Should show v22.16.0
npm --version   # Should show 10.9.2 or higher
```

### **2. Clean and Reinstall Dependencies**

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd vcarpool

# Clean existing dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Fresh install with Node.js 22
npm install

# Verify everything works
npm run build
npm test
```

### **3. Verify Your Setup**

Run our verification script to ensure your environment is properly configured:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root
chmod +x scripts/deploy-verification.sh
./scripts/deploy-verification.sh
```

This script will check:

- ✅ Node.js version compatibility
- ✅ Package.json engine requirements
- ✅ Build process functionality
- ✅ Test suite execution
- ✅ TypeScript compilation

---

## 🔧 **For Project Maintainers**

### **Infrastructure Updates**

- All Azure Functions now use Node.js 22 runtime
- CI/CD pipeline updated to use Node.js 22
- All Bicep templates and ARM configurations updated

### **Monitoring and Performance**

Run performance monitoring to establish new baselines:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/performance-monitor.js
node scripts/performance-monitor.js
```

This will generate detailed performance reports in the `performance-reports/` directory.

## ❗ **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Issue: `npm install` fails**

```bash
# Solution: Clear npm cache and retry
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### **Issue: Build fails with "Module not found"**

```bash
# Solution: Rebuild shared package
cd shared && npm run build && cd ..
npm run build
```

### **Issue: Tests fail unexpectedly**

```bash
# Solution: Clean environment and run tests
npm run clean  # If available
npm test
```

### **Issue: nvm not available**

```bash
# Install nvm on macOS/Linux
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc

# Install nvm on Windows
# Use nvm-windows: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows
```
