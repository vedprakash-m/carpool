```

**🌐 Development URLs:**

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:7071/api
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:7071/api/health

---

## �️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Modern Technology Stack**

```
🎯 Production Stack
Frontend: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Zustand
Backend: Azure Functions v4 + Node.js 22 + TypeScript
Database: Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL, serverless)
Caching: High-performance in-memory (Redis removed)
Auth: Microsoft Entra ID with SSO integration
IaC: Azure Bicep templates
CI/CD: GitHub Actions with quality gates
Testing: Jest + Playwright + 88.67% coverage
```

### **Enterprise Architecture Patterns**

1. **🏢 Serverless-First Design** - Auto-scaling Azure Functions with cold-start optimization
2. **🔒 Type-Safe Development** - Shared TypeScript types across frontend/backend
3. **📦 Domain-Driven Structure** - Clear separation of auth, trip management, and admin functions
4. **🗃️ Repository Pattern** - Consistent data access with dependency injection
5. **🔄 Middleware Chain** - Unified CORS, auth, validation, and error handling

## 🚀 **Deployment & Infrastructure**

### **💰 Cost-Optimized Multi-Resource Architecture**

Carpool implements an intelligent **dual-tier architecture** that separates persistent storage from compute:

**🗄️ Database Tier** (`vcarpool-db-rg`)

- **Always persistent** - Azure Cosmos DB with all user data
- **Never deleted** - Ensures data safety during cost optimization
- **~$24/month** - Predictable storage costs

**⚡ Compute Tier** (`vcarpool-rg`)

- **Deletable/Restorable** - Functions, Static Web App, Key Vault, Monitoring
- **70% cost savings** during inactive periods
- **5-minute restoration** via automated scripts
- **~$50-100/month** when active

### **🔄 Deployment Options**

**Automated CI/CD (Recommended)**

```bash
git push origin main  # Auto-deploy via GitHub Actions
```

**Manual Infrastructure Deployment**

```bash
./scripts/deploy-multi-rg.sh         # Full infrastructure setup
./scripts/cost-optimize.sh analyze   # Cost analysis
./scripts/cost-optimize.sh delete    # Hibernate compute tier
./scripts/cost-optimize.sh restore   # Restore in 5 minutes
```

### **🛡️ Production CI/CD Pipeline**

**3-Pipeline Architecture with Quality Gates:**

- **🔍 CI Pipeline** - Fast validation, parallel builds, security scanning
- **🚀 Deploy Pipeline** - Progressive deployment with health checks
- **🔧 Maintenance Pipeline** - Scheduled monitoring and performance testing
