# Carpool Group Management System

## Overview

The VCarpool application now includes a comprehensive carpool group management system that allows administrators to create organized carpool groups and invite families to join them. This feature addresses the core need for structured community-based transportation coordination.

## How It Works

### For Administrators

#### 1. **Create Carpool Groups**

- Access the group management through Admin Dashboard → "Carpool Groups"
- Create groups with specific details:
  - **Group Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "Lincoln Elementary Morning Carpool")
  - **School**: Associated educational institution
  - **Description**: Purpose and details of the group
  - **Pickup/Drop-off Locations**: Route information
  - **Schedule**: Days of the week and time slots
  - **Maximum Members**: Capacity limit for the group

#### 2. **Invite Parents and Children**

- Send email invitations to multiple families at once
- Include personalized messages with invitations
- Track invitation status (pending, accepted, declined)
- Set invitation expiration dates (default: 7 days)

#### 3. **Manage Group Membership**

- View all group members and their children
- Monitor group capacity and activity
- Update group information as needed
- Remove inactive members if necessary

### For Parents

#### 1. **View Invitations**

- Access through Parent Dashboard → "My Carpool Groups"
- See pending invitations with full group details
- Review schedule, route, and existing members
- Accept or decline invitations

#### 2. **Manage Memberships**

- View all joined carpool groups
- See other group members and their contact information
- Access children details within each group
- Leave groups if needed

#### 3. **Group Visibility**

- Parents can only see groups they belong to or have been invited to
- No access to other groups or admin functions
- Clear separation between member and invited groups

### For Students

- Students can view groups they're part of through their parent's membership
- Access to group schedules and member information
- Integration with assignment and pickup coordination
