## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT & INFRASTRUCTURE

### **Multi-Resource Group Architecture**

Carpool uses a cost-optimized architecture that separates persistent storage from compute:

**Database Tier** (`carpool-db-rg`):

- Azure Cosmos DB with all user data
- Always persistent, never deleted
- Cost: ~$24/month

**Compute Tier** (`carpool-rg`):

- Azure Functions, Static Web App, Key Vault, Monitoring
- Can be deleted during inactive periods (70% cost savings)
- Restoration time: 5 minutes via automated scripts
- Active cost: ~$50-100/month

### **Deployment Configuration**

**Required GitHub Secrets for CI/CD**:

| Secret Name                       | Description                      |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`                 | Azure App Registration Client ID |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID`                 | Azure AD Tenant ID               |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`           | Azure Subscription ID            |
| `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN` | Static Web Apps deployment token |

**Production Environment Variables**:

- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Admin authentication credential
- `COSMOS_DB_CONNECTION_STRING`: Database connection
- API keys for external services (Google Maps, SMS)
