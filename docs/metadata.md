## üéØ Production Readiness Remediation Plan

### 3-Week Rapid Consolidation Strategy (August 27 - September 16, 2025)

**Assessment**: 97% of infrastructure already exists. Primary challenge is configuration fragmentation, not missing features.

## üìä Production Monitoring Configuration

### Application Insights Setup

**Critical Monitoring Queries** (Ready for Implementation):

#### Authentication Success Rate Dashboard

```kql
// Authentication Success Rate (Last 24 hours)
requests
| where timestamp > ago(24h)
| where name == "auth-unified"
| extend action = tostring(customDimensions.action)
| summarize
    Total = count(),
    Success = countif(resultCode < 400),
    Failed = countif(resultCode >= 400)
    by action
| extend SuccessRate = round((Success * 100.0) / Total, 2)
| project action, Total, Success, Failed, SuccessRate
```

#### Performance Monitoring

```kql
// API Response Time Analysis
requests
| where timestamp > ago(1h)
| where name startswith "api/"
| summarize
    AvgDuration = avg(duration),
    P95Duration = percentile(duration, 95),
    RequestCount = count()
    by name
| order by AvgDuration desc
```

### Health Check Implementation

**Endpoint**: `/api/health-check` (Ready for Production)

```typescript
// Health check status monitoring
export async function healthCheck(request: HttpRequest, context: InvocationContext) {
  try {
    const dbStatus = await testDatabaseConnection();
    const jwtStatus = await testJWTService();
    const isHealthy = dbStatus && jwtStatus;

    return {
      status: isHealthy ? 200 : 503,
      jsonBody: {
        status: isHealthy ? 'healthy' : 'unhealthy',
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        checks: {
          database: dbStatus ? 'healthy' : 'unhealthy',
          jwt: jwtStatus ? 'healthy' : 'unhealthy',
        },
      },
    };
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      status: 503,
      jsonBody: {
        status: 'unhealthy',
        error: error.message,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      },
    };
  }
}
```
