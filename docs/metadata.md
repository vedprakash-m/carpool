_Last Updated: June 12, 2025_

## üéØ Project Overview

**VCarpool** is a comprehensive carpool management application designed specifically for school communities, starting with Tesla Stem High School in Redmond, WA. The platform connects families within a 25-mile radius for organized, safe, and reliable carpooling arrangements.

### Key Goals

- **Primary**: Enable safe, organized carpool management for Tesla Stem High School families
- **Geographic**: Serve families within 25 miles of Tesla Stem High School in Redmond, WA
- **Environmental Focus**: Promote sustainability through miles saved and time efficiency
- **Fairness**: Implement traveling parent support with flexible makeup scheduling
- **Technical**: Deliver a scalable, secure TypeScript-based application on Azure

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Smart Matching**: Geographic proximity with route optimization
- **Admin Controls**: Comprehensive group lifecycle management
- **Implementation**: `parent-group-creation`, `admin-carpool-groups` functions

### 4. Security & Monitoring

- **Rate Limiting**: Auth (5/15min), API (100/15min), Strict (20/15min)
- **Input Validation**: XSS prevention, SQL injection protection
- **Health Monitoring**: Application health checks and logging
- **Geographic Enforcement**: Service area validation

## üéØ Technical Debt Remediation Status

### **Current Progress: 80% Complete (MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED)**

#### ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Unified Services (100% Complete)**

- **UnifiedAuthService**: Consolidated authentication logic (598 lines)
- **UnifiedResponseHandler**: Standardized API responses (411 lines)
- **CorsMiddleware**: Environment-specific CORS handling (269 lines)
- **Middleware Infrastructure**: Composable middleware pipeline

#### ‚úÖ **Phase 2: Functions Refactored (43 of 46 functions)**

**Major Achievements:**

- **100+ manual CORS patterns eliminated** across all Azure Functions
- **Authentication patterns consolidated** across all endpoints
- **Error response formats standardized** using UnifiedResponseHandler
- **Azure Functions v4 compatibility** achieved for all modernized functions

**Key Functions Modernized:**

- All authentication endpoints (`auth-login-*`, `auth-register-*`)
- Admin management functions (`admin-*` series)
- Parent workflow functions (`parent-*` series)
- Core utilities (`trips-stats`, `users-me`, `hello`)

#### üìä **Impact Metrics**

- **Code Reduction**: 1,694 lines eliminated (54% reduction in last session)
- **Pattern Consistency**: 100% of modernized functions use unified response handling
- **Error Reduction**: Zero compilation errors across all optimized functions
- **Maintainability**: Significantly improved code consistency

## üöÄ Deployment & Infrastructure

### Multi-Resource Group Architecture (NEW - June 2025)

VCarpool now implements a **cost-optimized multi-resource group architecture** that separates persistent storage from compute resources, enabling significant cost savings during inactive development periods.

#### üóÑÔ∏è Database Resource Group (`vcarpool-db-rg`)

**Purpose**: Persistent data storage that runs continuously
**Resources**:

- Azure Cosmos DB account (`vcarpool-cosmos-prod`)
- Database: `vcarpool`
- Collections: `users`, `groups`, `trips`, `schedules`, `swapRequests`, etc.

**Cost**: ~$24/month (400 RU/s provisioned throughput)
**Status**: Always running (contains all user data)

#### ‚ö° Compute Resource Group (`vcarpool-rg`)

**Purpose**: Application runtime that can be deleted/recreated
**Resources**:

- Azure Function App (`vcarpool-api-prod`) - Backend API
- Static Web App (`vcarpool-web-prod`) - Frontend
- Storage Account (`vcarpoolsaprod`) - Function storage
- Application Insights (`vcarpool-insights-prod`) - Monitoring
- Key Vault (`vcarpool-kv-prod`) - Secrets management

**Cost**: ~$50-100/month (depending on usage)
**Status**: Can be deleted when not actively developing

#### üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Scripts

- **`./scripts/deploy-multi-rg.sh`** - Deploy complete infrastructure
- **`./scripts/cost-optimize.sh`** - Manage cost optimization
  - `analyze` - Show current resources and costs
  - `delete` - Delete compute resources (save ~$50-100/month)
  - `restore` - Recreate compute resources from templates
  - `status` - Check deletion progress

#### üí∞ Cost Optimization Strategy

1. **Active Development**: Both resource groups running (~$75-125/month)
2. **Inactive Period**: Delete compute resources (~$24/month, 70% savings)
3. **Return to Development**: Restore compute resources in ~5 minutes
4. **Data Safety**: Database remains untouched during optimization

**Key Benefits**:

- Zero data loss during cost optimization cycles
- Quick restoration (5-minute deployment vs. hours of setup)
- Separation of concerns (data vs. compute)
- Granular cost control

### Legacy Single Resource Group

**Previous Architecture**: All resources in `vcarpool-rg`
**Status**: Still supported via `infra/main.bicep`
**Migration**: Automatic via CI/CD pipeline updates

### Azure Resources (Current Production)

- **Azure Functions App**: Backend API hosting
- **Azure Static Web Apps**: Frontend hosting with CDN
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: Primary database (serverless)
- **Azure Key Vault**: Secrets and configuration management
- **Azure Application Insights**: Monitoring and analytics

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Environment Management**: Development, staging, production
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability assessment
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time application metrics

## üìã Current Status & Next Steps

### ‚úÖ **Completed**

- Core carpool management functionality
- Tesla Stem High School integration
- Geographic validation system
- Traveling parent fairness implementation
- Major technical debt remediation (80% complete)
- Azure Functions modernization
- CORS pattern elimination
- **NEW: Address Collection in Registration** (June 12, 2025)

### üÜï **Recent Implementation: Registration Address Collection**

**Completion Date**: June 12, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fully Implemented

#### **Problem Identified**

- Gap between User_Experience.md documentation (showed address collection) and actual registration form implementation (no address collection)
- Basic registration form (`/register/page.tsx`) lacked home address validation step
- Inconsistent type system between frontend and backend RegisterRequest interfaces

#### **Solution Implemented**

1. **Enhanced Registration Flow**:

   - **Step 1**: Family Information (parent details, optional second parent)
   - **Step 2**: Home Address Verification (NEW - with real-time validation)
   - **Step 3**: Children Information (grade, school selection)

2. **Address Validation Integration**:

   - Integrated existing `AddressValidation` component into registration flow
   - Real-time geocoding verification with Tesla STEM High School service area validation
   - 25-mile radius enforcement with distance calculation
   - User-friendly address suggestions for invalid addresses

3. **Type System Updates**:

   - Updated `RegisterRequest` interface in all type definitions:
     - `/frontend/src/types/shared.ts`
     - `/shared/src/types.ts`
     - `/backend/src/types/shared.ts`
   - Added comprehensive `homeAddress` object with street, city, state, zipCode fields

4. **Form Enhancement**:
   - Enhanced Zod schema validation for address fields
   - Added address validation state management
   - Implemented step-by-step navigation with validation gates
   - Disabled progression until address validation is complete

#### **Technical Implementation Details**

- **Files Modified**: 5 files across frontend, shared, and backend packages
- **Backend APIs Used**: `address-validation/index.js`, `universal-address-validation/index.js`
- **Frontend Components**: Enhanced registration form with AddressValidation integration
- **State Management**: Added `addressValidated` boolean state with validation callbacks

#### **User Experience Impact**

- **Consistency**: Registration flow now matches documented UX requirements
- **Data Quality**: All families will have validated home addresses before group access
- **Geographic Accuracy**: Ensures only eligible families (within service area) can register
- **Error Prevention**: Real-time validation prevents registration with invalid addresses

#### **Testing Status**

- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful
- ‚úÖ Component integration verified
- ‚úÖ Address validation flow functional
- ‚úÖ Multi-step form navigation working

#### **Documentation Updates**

- ‚úÖ Updated User_Experience.md wireframes to reflect actual implementation
- ‚úÖ Added Phase 4 completion status to implementation tracking
- ‚úÖ Documented progress in metadata.md
