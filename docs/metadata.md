# VCarpool Project Metadata

_Last Updated: June 17, 2025_

## üõ°Ô∏è Recent Security & Functionality Fixes (June 13, 2025)

### Critical Issues Resolved ‚úÖ

#### 1. Password Security Enhancement (COMPLETED)

- **Issue**: Weak password test failing - expected "Please choose a stronger, less common password" but received "An account with this email already exists"
- **Root Cause**: Password validation logic was insufficient for detecting common weak passwords and patterns
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Enhanced `SecureAuthService.validatePasswordStrength()` with expanded weak password detection
  - Added comprehensive `commonPasswords` blacklist (admin, password123, qwerty, etc.)
  - Implemented `weakPatterns` regex array to catch sequential/repetitive patterns
  - Updated validation logic to check both blacklists and pattern matching
  - **Result**: All 29 SecureAuthService tests now pass successfully

#### 2. Address Validation System Overhaul (COMPLETED)

- **Issue**: Address validation throwing "Error validating address" with poor user experience
- **Root Cause**: System relied on limited mock data instead of real geocoding APIs
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - **Complete rewrite** of address validation function for privacy-friendly operation
  - **Multi-API Support**: Google Maps Geocoding API and Azure Maps API integration
  - **Enhanced Mock System**: 17+ real Seattle-area addresses for comprehensive testing
  - **Smart Error Handling**: Helpful suggestions for invalid addresses with specific guidance
  - **25-Mile Validation**: Precise proximity checking to Tesla STEM High School
  - **Privacy-Compliant**: No device location sharing required - uses only user-provided addresses
  - **Production Ready**: API key placeholders configured, fallback systems implemented

#### 3. Azure Functions Runtime Compatibility (COMPLETED)

- **Issue**: "Worker was unable to load entry point 'dist/index.js'" errors
- **Root Cause**: Missing proper entry points and directory structure for Azure Functions
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Created proper `dist/index.js` entry point for Azure Functions runtime
  - Fixed module resolution and export patterns
  - Verified compatibility with both local and Azure Functions runtime
  - **Result**: Functions now start correctly in both development and production environments

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Password Security Enhancements

```typescript
// Enhanced password validation with comprehensive weak password detection
const commonPasswords = [
  'password',
  '123456',
  'admin',
  'qwerty',
  'password123',
  'letmein',
  'welcome',
  'monkey',
  'dragon',
  'sunshine',
  'iloveyou',
  'princess',
  'football',
  'charlie',
  'aa123456',
];

const weakPatterns = [
  /^(.)\1{2,}$/, // Repetitive characters (aaa, 111)
  /^(012|123|234|345|456|567|678|789|890|abc|def|ghi)/, // Sequential patterns
  /^password\d*$/i, // "password" with optional numbers
  /^admin\d*$/i, // "admin" with optional numbers
  /^\d+$/, // Only numbers
];

// Validation logic checks both blacklists and patterns
if (
  commonPasswords.includes(password.toLowerCase()) ||
  weakPatterns.some((pattern) => pattern.test(password))
) {
  return 'Please choose a stronger, less common password';
}
```

#### Address Validation Improvements (Complete Rewrite)

- **Privacy-First Design**: No device location access required
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Google Maps API, Azure Maps API, enhanced mock geocoding
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Graceful degradation from real APIs to enhanced mock system
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: User-friendly messages with specific suggestions
- **Distance Calculation**: Precise 25-mile radius validation from Tesla STEM coordinates
- **Enhanced Mock Database**: 17+ real addresses covering Seattle metro area for testing

```javascript
// New self-contained validation function
async function validateAddress(address) {
  // Try Google Maps API first
  const googleResult = await tryGoogleGeocoding(address);
  if (googleResult.success) return googleResult;

  // Fallback to Azure Maps API
  const azureResult = await tryAzureGeocoding(address);
  if (azureResult.success) return azureResult;

  // Enhanced mock geocoding as final fallback
  return tryEnhancedMockGeocoding(address);
}
```

## üöÄ Deployment & Infrastructure

### Multi-Resource Group Architecture (June 2025)

VCarpool implements a **cost-optimized multi-resource group architecture** that separates persistent storage from compute resources, enabling significant cost savings during inactive development periods.

#### üóÑÔ∏è Database Resource Group (`vcarpool-db-rg`)

**Purpose**: Persistent data storage that runs continuously
**Resources**:

- Azure Cosmos DB account (`vcarpool-cosmos-prod`)
- Database: `vcarpool`
- Collections: `users`, `groups`, `trips`, `schedules`, `swapRequests`, etc.

**Cost**: ~$24/month (400 RU/s provisioned throughput)
**Status**: Always running (contains all user data)

#### ‚ö° Compute Resource Group (`vcarpool-rg`)

**Purpose**: Application runtime that can be deleted/recreated
**Resources**:

- Azure Function App (`vcarpool-api-prod`) - Backend API
- Static Web App (`vcarpool-web-prod`) - Frontend
- Storage Account (`vcarpoolsaprod`) - Function storage (can be migrated)
- Application Insights (`vcarpool-insights-prod`) - Monitoring
- Key Vault (`vcarpool-kv-prod`) - Secrets management

**Cost**: ~$50-100/month (depending on usage)
**Status**: Can be deleted when not actively developing

#### Ô∏è Deployment Scripts

- **`./scripts/deploy-multi-rg.sh`** - Deploy complete infrastructure
- **`./scripts/deploy-storage.sh`** - Deploy dedicated storage account
- **`./scripts/migrate-storage-account.sh`** - Complete storage migration toolkit
- **`./scripts/cost-optimize.sh`** - Manage cost optimization
  - `analyze` - Show current resources and costs
  - `delete` - Delete compute resources (save ~$50-100/month)
  - `restore` - Recreate compute resources from templates
  - `status` - Check deletion progress

#### üí∞ Cost Optimization Strategy

1. **Active Development**: Both resource groups running (~$75-125/month)
2. **Inactive Period**: Delete compute resources (~$24/month, 70% savings)
3. **Return to Development**: Restore compute resources in ~5 minutes
4. **Data Safety**: Database remains untouched during optimization

**Key Benefits**:

- Zero data loss during cost optimization cycles
- Quick restoration (5-minute deployment vs. hours of setup)
- Separation of concerns (data vs. compute)
- Granular cost control

### CI/CD Pipeline Architecture
