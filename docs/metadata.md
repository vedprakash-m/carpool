# VCarpool Project Metadata

_Last Updated: June 12, 2025_

## 🎯 Project Overview

**VCarpool** is a comprehensive carpool management application designed specifically for school communities, starting with Tesla Stem High School in Redmond, WA. The platform connects families within a 25-mile radius for organized, safe, and reliable carpooling arrangements.

### Key Goals

- **Primary**: Enable safe, organized carpool management for Tesla Stem High School families
- **Geographic**: Serve families within 25 miles of Tesla Stem High School in Redmond, WA
- **Environmental Focus**: Promote sustainability through miles saved and time efficiency
- **Fairness**: Implement traveling parent support with flexible makeup scheduling
- **Technical**: Deliver a scalable, secure TypeScript-based application on Azure

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Azure Static Web Apps
- **Backend**: Node.js 22+, Azure Functions v4, TypeScript
- **Database**: Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL, serverless), Redis (caching)
- **Infrastructure**: Azure Functions, Static Web Apps, Bicep templates
- **Shared**: npm workspaces, TypeScript types, Zod validation

### Core Components

1. **Frontend (Next.js)** - User interface, client-side routing, authentication flows
2. **Backend (Azure Functions)** - REST API, business logic, data validation
3. **Shared Package** - Common TypeScript types, validation schemas, utilities
4. **Database Layer** - Cosmos DB for persistence, Redis for sessions/caching

## ✅ Core Features (Implemented)

### 1. Tesla Stem Registration & Validation System

- **Registration-First Access**: Complete registration required before group discovery
- **Geographic Restriction**: 25-mile radius enforcement from Tesla Stem High School
- **Three-Tier Verification**: Phone (SMS), address (geocoding), emergency contacts
- **Implementation**: `phone-verification`, `address-validation`, `emergency-contact-verification` functions

### 2. Traveling Parent Fairness System

- **Makeup Trip Scheduling**: Flexible 2-6 week makeup window
- **Balance Tracking**: Real-time debt/credit system for trip obligations
- **Automated Notifications**: SMS/email alerts for makeup scheduling
- **Implementation**: `traveling-parent-makeup`, `admin-assignment-reminders` functions

### 3. Group Formation & Management

- **Family Unit Model**: Single logical unit for multi-student families
- **Smart Matching**: Geographic proximity with route optimization
- **Admin Controls**: Comprehensive group lifecycle management
- **Implementation**: `parent-group-creation`, `admin-carpool-groups` functions

### 4. Security & Monitoring

- **Rate Limiting**: Auth (5/15min), API (100/15min), Strict (20/15min)
- **Input Validation**: XSS prevention, SQL injection protection
- **Health Monitoring**: Application health checks and logging
- **Geographic Enforcement**: Service area validation

## 🎯 Technical Debt Remediation Status

### **Current Progress: 80% Complete (MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED)**

#### ✅ **Phase 1: Unified Services (100% Complete)**

- **UnifiedAuthService**: Consolidated authentication logic (598 lines)
- **UnifiedResponseHandler**: Standardized API responses (411 lines)
- **CorsMiddleware**: Environment-specific CORS handling (269 lines)
- **Middleware Infrastructure**: Composable middleware pipeline

#### ✅ **Phase 2: Functions Refactored (43 of 46 functions)**

**Major Achievements:**

- **100+ manual CORS patterns eliminated** across all Azure Functions
- **Authentication patterns consolidated** across all endpoints
- **Error response formats standardized** using UnifiedResponseHandler
- **Azure Functions v4 compatibility** achieved for all modernized functions

**Key Functions Modernized:**

- All authentication endpoints (`auth-login-*`, `auth-register-*`)
- Admin management functions (`admin-*` series)
- Parent workflow functions (`parent-*` series)
- Core utilities (`trips-stats`, `users-me`, `hello`)

#### 📊 **Impact Metrics**

- **Code Reduction**: 1,694 lines eliminated (54% reduction in last session)
- **Pattern Consistency**: 100% of modernized functions use unified response handling
- **Error Reduction**: Zero compilation errors across all optimized functions
- **Maintainability**: Significantly improved code consistency

## 🚀 Deployment & Infrastructure

### Azure Resources

- **Azure Functions App**: Backend API hosting
- **Azure Static Web Apps**: Frontend hosting with CDN
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: Primary database (serverless)
- **Azure Key Vault**: Secrets and configuration management
- **Azure Application Insights**: Monitoring and analytics

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Environment Management**: Development, staging, production
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability assessment
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time application metrics
