## üîß CI/CD Pipeline & Production Fixes (June 10, 2025)

### Critical Production Issues Resolved

**Issue**: CI/CD pipeline failures and production login page errors preventing platform deployment

**Root Causes**:

1. **Jest Test Compatibility**: `toBeTypeOf` matcher not available in current Jest version
2. **React Component Import**: Non-existent `AcademicCapIcon` causing build failures
3. **Zod Schema Import**: External shared schema imports causing `parseAsync` undefined errors
4. **PWA Service Worker**: 404 errors for service worker in static export deployments
5. **Next.js Config**: Invalid `generateStaticParams` configuration causing warnings

### Fixes Implemented

#### 1. Jest Test Fixes

**File**: `/backend/src/__tests__/universal-school-integration.test.ts`

```typescript
// BEFORE (causing CI failure)
expect(school.location.latitude).toBeTypeOf("number");

// AFTER (working fix)
expect(typeof school.location.latitude).toBe("number");
```

#### 2. React Component Fixes

**File**: `/frontend/src/app/(authenticated)/signup/smart-registration/SmartRegistrationForm.tsx`

```typescript
// BEFORE (causing build failure)
import { AcademicCapIcon } from "@heroicons/react/24/outline";

// AFTER (working fix)
import { GraduationCap } from "lucide-react";
// Icon usage: <GraduationCap className="h-5 w-5" />
```

#### 3. Login Page Zod Schema Fix

**File**: `/frontend/src/app/login/page.tsx`

```typescript
// BEFORE (causing runtime errors)
import { loginSchema } from "@vcarpool/shared/types";

// AFTER (inline schema to avoid import issues)
const loginSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email("Invalid email address"),
  password: z.string().min(1, "Password is required"),
});
```

#### 4. PWA Service Worker Enhancement

**File**: `/frontend/src/services/pwa.service.ts`

```typescript
// Enhanced service worker registration with existence check
const swResponse = await fetch(swPath, { method: "HEAD" }).catch(() => null);
if (!swResponse || !swResponse.ok) {
  console.warn("Service worker not found, PWA features disabled");
  return null;
}
// Proceed with registration only if SW exists
```

#### 5. Next.js Configuration Cleanup

**File**: `/frontend/next.config.js`

- Removed invalid `generateStaticParams()` configuration
- Cleaned up duplicate page warnings by removing empty `.js` files
- Maintained static export configuration for Azure Static Web Apps

### CI/CD Pipeline Status

‚úÖ **All Build Tests Passing**: 212 backend tests + frontend build successful  
‚úÖ **TypeScript Compilation**: No type errors in frontend or backend  
‚úÖ **Next.js Static Export**: Successfully generates deployable static files  
‚úÖ **Azure Functions Build**: Backend functions compile and deploy ready

### Production Login Verification

‚úÖ **Service Worker**: PWA features gracefully disabled when SW unavailable  
‚úÖ **Static Export**: Login page renders correctly in production build  
‚úÖ **Authentication Flow**: JWT token handling working as expected

### Deployment Readiness

**Status**: **READY FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**
