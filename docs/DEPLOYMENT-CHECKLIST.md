## ðŸŽ¯ **Deployment Steps**

### **Phase 1: Development Environment (Immediate)**

- [ ] Deploy to development Azure environment
- [ ] Verify Azure Functions start correctly with Node.js 22
- [ ] Test all API endpoints functionality
- [ ] Verify frontend builds and deploys to Static Web Apps
- [ ] Run integration tests in development environment
- [ ] Monitor for any runtime errors or performance issues

### **Phase 2: Performance Validation (Day 1-2)**

- [ ] Run performance monitoring script (`npm run monitor-performance`)
- [ ] Compare metrics with Node.js 18 baseline
- [ ] Verify build times are within acceptable range
- [ ] Check memory usage patterns
- [ ] Monitor cold start times for Azure Functions

### **Phase 3: Staging Environment (Day 2-3)**

- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Run full test suite in staging
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing
- [ ] Load testing with Node.js 22
- [ ] Security scanning and validation
- [ ] Database connection and query performance verification

### **Phase 4: Production Deployment (Day 3-7)**

- [ ] Schedule maintenance window
- [ ] Backup current production environment
- [ ] Deploy infrastructure updates (Bicep templates)
- [ ] Deploy backend to Azure Functions
- [ ] Deploy frontend to Static Web Apps
- [ ] Verify all services are operational
- [ ] Monitor application health for 24 hours

---

## ðŸ“Š **Post-Deployment Monitoring**

### **Immediate Monitoring (First 24 Hours)**

- [ ] Application Insights metrics review
- [ ] Error rate monitoring
- [ ] Response time analysis
- [ ] Memory usage patterns
- [ ] Function execution times
- [ ] User experience validation

### **Performance Benchmarks to Track**

- [ ] **Build Times**: Should be â‰¤ previous Node.js 18 times
- [ ] **Test Execution**: Should be similar or faster
- [ ] **Cold Start Times**: Monitor Azure Functions startup
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: Track heap and RSS memory
- [ ] **API Response Times**: Should be same or improved
- [ ] **Database Query Performance**: Verify no degradation

### **Weekly Monitoring (First Month)**

- [ ] Performance trend analysis
- [ ] Error pattern identification
- [ ] Security vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Dependency update review
- [ ] User feedback collection

---

## ðŸš¨ **Rollback Plan**

### **Triggers for Rollback**

- Critical errors affecting functionality
- Performance degradation > 20%
- Security vulnerabilities introduced
- User-facing issues not quickly resolvable

### **Rollback Procedure**

- [ ] **Step 1**: Revert infrastructure to Node.js 18 configuration
- [ ] **Step 2**: Redeploy previous working version
- [ ] **Step 3**: Verify all services operational
- [ ] **Step 4**: Document issues encountered
- [ ] **Step 5**: Plan remediation strategy

### **Rollback Assets**

- [ ] Previous infrastructure templates backed up
- [ ] Previous application version tagged in git
- [ ] Database backup confirmed available
- [ ] Configuration backup verified

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Validation Commands**

### **Quick Health Check**

```bash
# Verify deployment
npm run verify-deployment

# Check performance
npm run monitor-performance

# Run full test suite
npm test

# Build verification
npm run build
```

### **Azure Environment Verification**

```bash
# Check Function App status
az functionapp list --query "[?contains(name, 'vcarpool')].{Name:name, State:state, RuntimeVersion:siteConfig.linuxFxVersion}"

# Check Static Web App status
az staticwebapp list --query "[?contains(name, 'vcarpool')].{Name:name, Status:repositoryUrl}"

# Monitor function logs
az monitor activity-log list --resource-group vcarpool-rg-dev --max-events 10
```
