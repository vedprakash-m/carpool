## ðŸŽ¯ **Deployment Process**

### **Automated Deployment (GitHub Actions)**

The deployment process is fully automated via GitHub Actions when pushing to `main` branch:

1. **Build Phase**:

   - [ ] Backend functions build successfully
   - [ ] Frontend builds and creates static export
   - [ ] All tests pass

2. **Infrastructure Phase**:

   - [ ] Azure resources created/updated via Bicep
   - [ ] Database containers provisioned
   - [ ] Function App and Static Web App configured

3. **Application Deployment**:

   - [ ] Backend functions deployed to Azure Functions
   - [ ] Frontend deployed to Azure Static Web Apps
   - [ ] Health checks pass

4. **Verification Phase**:
   - [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
   - [ ] Frontend loads and functions
   - [ ] Database connectivity confirmed

---

## ðŸ“Š **Post-Deployment Monitoring**

### **Immediate Health Checks (First 30 minutes)**

- [ ] API health endpoint: `GET /api/health` returns 200
- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] Authentication flow works
- [ ] Trip management operations function
- [ ] Database read/write operations succeed

### **Performance Validation (First 24 Hours)**

- [ ] Response times within SLA targets:
  - Authentication: < 500ms
  - Trip search: < 1000ms
  - Trip operations: < 800ms
- [ ] Error rate < 5%
- [ ] No memory leaks or resource issues
- [ ] Cold start times acceptable (< 3 seconds)

### **Functional Testing**

- [ ] User registration and login working
- [ ] Trip creation and search functioning
- [ ] Join/leave trip operations successful
- [ ] Email notifications being sent
- [ ] Data persistence verified

---

## ðŸš¨ **Rollback Plan**

### **Triggers for Rollback**

- Critical errors preventing core functionality
- Performance degradation > 50% from baseline
- Security vulnerabilities discovered
- Data integrity issues

### **Rollback Procedure**

1. **Access GitHub Actions**:

   - Go to repository Actions tab
   - Select "VCarpool Rollback Pipeline"

2. **Execute Rollback**:

   - Choose component: All/Backend/Frontend/Infrastructure
   - Enter target git tag/commit (last known good)
   - Type "CONFIRM" to proceed

3. **Verify Rollback**:
   - [ ] Application functionality restored
   - [ ] Performance metrics normal
   - [ ] No data corruption
   - [ ] User experience stable

---

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Validation**

### **Backend Validation**

```bash
# Health check
curl https://vcarpool-api-prod.azurewebsites.net/api/health

# Authentication test
curl -X POST https://vcarpool-api-prod.azurewebsites.net/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"testpass"}'
```

### **Frontend Validation**

```bash
# Basic connectivity
curl -I https://vcarpool-web-prod.azurestaticapps.net

# Resource loading
curl -I https://vcarpool-web-prod.azurestaticapps.net/favicon.ico
```

### **Database Validation**

- [ ] Cosmos DB containers accessible
- [ ] Read operations functioning
- [ ] Write operations functioning
- [ ] Query performance acceptable

---

## âœ… **Success Criteria**

### **Functional Requirements**

- [ ] All user authentication workflows working
- [ ] Trip creation and management functional
- [ ] Search and filtering operations working
- [ ] Email notifications operational
- [ ] Data persistence and retrieval correct

### **Performance Requirements**

- [ ] API response times meet SLA targets
- [ ] Page load times < 3 seconds
