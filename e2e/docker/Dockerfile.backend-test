# Multi-stage Dockerfile for Backend E2E Testing in Monorepo
# This Dockerfile builds the shared package first, then the backend

# Stage 1: Build shared package
FROM node:20-alpine AS shared-builder

WORKDIR /app

# Copy root package files
COPY package*.json ./
COPY tsconfig.json ./

# Install dependencies and build shared package
RUN npm ci --ignore-scripts
RUN npm run build --workspace=shared

# Stage 2: Build backend
FROM node:20-alpine AS backend-builder

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies for the entire monorepo
RUN npm ci --ignore-scripts

# Build shared package (in case it wasn't copied properly)
RUN npm run build --workspace=shared

# Build backend
RUN cd backend && npm run build

# Stage 3: Production runtime
FROM node:20-alpine AS runtime

WORKDIR /app

# Install curl for health checks
