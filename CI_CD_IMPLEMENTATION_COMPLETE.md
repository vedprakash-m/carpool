## 🏗️ **New Pipeline Structure**

### **1. CI Pipeline** (`ci-pipeline.yml`)

**Trigger**: Pull requests, pushes to main, manual dispatch

```
Quick Validation → Parallel CI (Backend/Frontend/Shared) → Security Scan
     ↓
Quality Gate → Integration Tests → E2E Tests → Performance Tests
     ↓
Deployment Gate → Trigger Deployment Pipeline
```

**Features:**

- ✅ Fail-fast validation (< 5 minutes)
- ✅ Parallel component builds
- ✅ Mandatory quality gates
- ✅ Smart change detection
- ✅ Coverage threshold enforcement (70%)
- ✅ Artifact management
- ✅ Pipeline status reporting

### **2. Deploy Pipeline** (`deploy-pipeline.yml`)

**Trigger**: Successful CI pipeline, manual dispatch

```
Deployment Planning → Pre-deployment Validation → Infrastructure Deploy
     ↓
Backend Deploy → Frontend Deploy → Health Checks → Post-deployment Validation
     ↓
Deployment Completion → (Auto-rollback on failure)
```

**Features:**

- ✅ Smart change detection
- ✅ Progressive deployment strategy
- ✅ Comprehensive health checks
- ✅ Automatic rollback triggers
- ✅ Environment-specific deployments
- ✅ Deployment status tracking

### **3. Maintenance Pipeline** (`maintenance-pipeline.yml`)

**Trigger**: Scheduled (daily security, weekly performance), manual dispatch

```
Maintenance Planning → Security Scan → Performance Monitor → Dependency Check → Cleanup
     ↓
Maintenance Summary → Issue Creation (on critical findings)
```

**Features:**

- ✅ Scheduled security scans
- ✅ Performance monitoring
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability checks
- ✅ Automated issue creation
- ✅ Comprehensive reporting

### **4. Supporting Workflows**

- **Rollback Pipeline** (`rollback.yml`): Emergency rollback with validation
- **E2E Tests** (`e2e-tests.yml`): End-to-end testing (called by CI)
- **Performance Tests** (`perf.yml`): Standalone performance testing
- **Setup Node** (`_setup-node.yml`): Reusable workflow template

## 🔒 **Quality Gates & Safety**

### **Stage 1: Quick Validation**

- Package structure validation
- Dependency check
- Change detection
- **Fail time**: < 5 minutes

### **Stage 2: Quality Gate**

- All CI jobs must pass
- Test coverage ≥ 70%
- Security scan success
- **Blocks**: Further progression

### **Stage 3: Deployment Gate**

- Integration tests pass
- E2E tests pass (main branch)
- Performance tests pass (optional)
- **Blocks**: Production deployment

## 🚦 **Pipeline Flow Control**

### **Pull Request Flow**

```
PR Created → CI Pipeline → Quality Gate → Integration Tests → E2E Tests → Ready for Review
```

### **Main Branch Flow**

```
Push to Main → CI Pipeline → Quality Gate → Integration + E2E + Performance Tests
→ Deployment Gate → Deploy Pipeline → Production Deployment
```

### **Emergency Flow**

```
Critical Issue → Rollback Pipeline → Validate → Infrastructure + Backend + Frontend Rollback
```

## 📈 **Monitoring & Reporting**

### **Pipeline Health Metrics**

- ✅ Success/failure rates per stage
- ✅ Pipeline execution times
- ✅ Quality gate pass rates
- ✅ Deployment frequency
- ✅ Rollback frequency

### **Automated Reporting**

- ✅ Pipeline summary in GitHub UI
- ✅ Deployment status updates
- ✅ Security findings reports
- ✅ Performance metrics
- ✅ Issue creation for critical findings

## 🛠️ **Usage Guide**

### **Triggering CI Pipeline**

```bash
# Automatic: Push/PR to main with relevant changes
git push origin feature/my-feature

# Manual: With options
# Go to Actions → CI Pipeline → Run workflow
# Options: Skip tests, Run performance tests
```

### **Triggering Deployment**

```bash
# Automatic: After successful CI on main branch

# Manual deployment:
# Go to Actions → Deploy Pipeline → Run workflow
# Options: Force deploy, Skip health checks, Environment
```

### **Emergency Rollback**

```bash
# Go to Actions → Rollback Pipeline → Run workflow
# Required: Reason (deployment-failure, critical-bug, etc.)
# Optional: Target version, Failed deployment ID
```

### **Maintenance Operations**

```bash
# Automatic: Daily security scans, Weekly performance

# Manual maintenance:
# Go to Actions → Maintenance Pipeline → Run workflow
# Options: security-scan, performance-monitoring, dependency-update, cleanup, full-maintenance
```

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### **Environment Variables**

```yaml
NODE_VERSION: '20' # Node.js version
COVERAGE_THRESHOLD: 70 # Test coverage threshold
AZURE_LOCATION: 'eastus' # Azure deployment region
HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT: 300 # Health check timeout (seconds)
DEPLOYMENT_TIMEOUT: 1800 # Deployment timeout (seconds)
```

### **Required Secrets**

```yaml
AZURE_CLIENT_ID                   # Azure service principal
AZURE_TENANT_ID                   # Azure tenant ID
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID             # Azure subscription ID
```

## 🚨 **Failure Handling**

### **CI Pipeline Failures**

- **Quick Validation**: Fix package/dependency issues
- **Component CI**: Fix build/test/lint errors
- **Security Scan**: Address vulnerabilities
- **Quality Gate**: All upstream jobs must pass

### **Deployment Failures**

- **Auto-rollback**: Triggered for production failures
- **Manual intervention**: Required for partial failures
- **Health checks**: Validate deployment success

### **Emergency Procedures**

1. **Critical Issues**: Use rollback pipeline immediately
2. **Security Issues**: Maintenance pipeline → immediate patching
3. **Performance Issues**: Performance pipeline → analysis
