- 87.74% backend coverage maintained
- JWT authentication workflow validated
- Service integration tests confirmed

### Production Validation Complete

- JWT secret minimum length enforced (32+ characters)
- Azure Entra ID tenant/client configuration validated
- Cosmos DB connection requirements verified
- Application Insights monitoring readiness confirmed

## âœ… PHASE 2 COMPLETE: Infrastructure Optimization & CI/CD Alignment (Week 2)

### Migration & Infrastructure Alignment Successfully Completed

- **CI/CD Alignment**: âœ… Bicep templates and GitHub Actions updated to reference existing infrastructure
- **Documentation**: âœ… Infrastructure status documented in docs/INFRASTRUCTURE_STATUS.md

### Phase 2 Achievements

1. **Azure Resource Optimization**
   - âœ… Migrated from Y1 to Flex Consumption Function App
   - âœ… Performance improved with dedicated ASP-carpoolrg-b937 plan
   - âœ… All 23 functions deployed and accessible
   - âœ… Updated CI/CD pipeline to target new Function App
   - âœ… Fixed TypeScript compilation issues
   - âœ… Cleaned up old Y1 infrastructure (Function App, App Service Plan, Application Insights)
2. **Infrastructure as Code Alignment**
   - âœ… Bicep templates updated to reference existing resources (no new creation)
   - âœ… CI/CD pipeline configured for existing infrastructure deployment
   - âœ… Resource naming aligned with actual Azure resources
   - âœ… Prevented redundant resource creation through template updates
3. **Environment Configuration**
   - âœ… Production-ready Flex Consumption configuration
   - âœ… All deploy scripts updated to new Function App
   - âœ… Health checks configured for new endpoint
4. **Testing & Validation**
   - âœ… Backend deployment successful
   - âœ… All function endpoints available and responding
   - âœ… Health checks passing
   - âœ… Migration completed with no downtime
   - âœ… Infrastructure documentation complete

## ðŸš€ PHASE 3 ACTIVE: Operations & Monitoring (Week 3)

### Current Priority: Frontend Deployment & Integration

- **Next Action**: Deploy frontend to Static Web App
- **Backend Status**: âœ… Flex Consumption Function App fully operational
- **Frontend Build**: Ready for production deployment
- **Integration**: Configure frontend to use new backend URLs

### Phase 3 Objectives

1. **Frontend Deployment**
   - Deploy Next.js frontend to Static Web App
   - Configure environment variables for production
   - Set up custom domain (if needed)
2. **Full Integration Testing**
   - End-to-end workflow validation
   - Authentication flow testing
   - Performance baseline establishment
3. **Monitoring & Operations**
   - Application Insights dashboards
   - Alert configuration
   - Performance optimization
   - Security hardening validation

## Infrastructure Assets Ready for Deployment

- **Bicep Templates**: Complete infrastructure as code (/infra directory)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript production build ready
- **Backend**: Azure Functions v4 with unified service architecture
  - **New Flex Consumption App**: `carpool-backend` (2048 MB, Node.js 22 LTS)
  - **Legacy Y1 App**: `carpool-api-prod` (to be retired after migration)
- **Database**: Cosmos DB schema and connection service prepared
- **Authentication**: Microsoft Entra ID integration fully configured

## Latest Technical Achievements

- Fixed JWT token generation conflicts (removed duplicate exp/iss/aud properties)
- Enhanced configuration service with production security validation
- All authentication integration tests now passing
- Production environment template provides secure configuration baseline
- **Flex Consumption Migration**: Created new `carpool-backend` Function App with improved performance
- **Updated CI/CD**: Pipeline now targets new Flex Consumption app

**Status: Ready for Infrastructure Deployment Phase**
